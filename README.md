# Flexbox: To Do App

## Overview
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a to-do web app. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, however, a few Flexbox values are missing.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to set an elementâ€™s Flexbox properties.

## Installation
Set up a html:5 and css doc in your text editor of choice.

## Steps
1.
Start off by turning some of the elements into <code>flex</code> and <code>inline-flex</code> containers.

    Turn elements with the class container and elements with the class square into flex containers.
    Turn elements with the class week and elements with the class reminders into inline-flex containers.

To do this, add the display property with a value of either <code>flex</code> or <code>inline-flex</code>.

2.
The elements inside the new <code>inline-flex</code> containers should grow to fill the container. This is accomplished using the <code>flex-grow</code> property:

    Elements with the class .week will get a flex-grow property with a value of 3.
    Elements with the class .reminders will get a flex-grow property with a value of 2.

3.
We want the flex items with the class week to be ordered vertically, instead of horizontally.

Inside the <code>.week</code> ruleset, add a <code>flex-direction</code> property with the value that orders the items in a column.

4.
The items with the class <code>row</code> should move to the next line when the container gets too small.

Inside the <code>.row</code> ruleset, add a .ro<code>.row</code> property with the value that moves items to the next row, while keeping their order intact.

5.
The items with the class row also need some space:

Inside the <code>.row</code> ruleset, add a <code>justify-content</code> property with the value that adds space around each item.

Furthermore, the items with the class <code>square</code> need to be centered:6.

Inside the <code>.square ruleset</code>, add a <code>justify-content</code> property with the value that centers the items in the container.

6.
Lastly, the elements with the class <code>row</code> and elements with the class <code>square</code> need to be aligned vertically:

Inside the rulesets for <code>.row</code> and <code>.square</code>, add the <code>align-items</code> property with the value that centers the items inside the container.

You did it! Great work. Now resize the browser to see your flex properties in action!
